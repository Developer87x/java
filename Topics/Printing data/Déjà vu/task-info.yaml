  message: "<html>In Java, using the + operator with strings concatenates (or glues\
    \ together) whatever follows. \nThat's why it converts the number 5 into \"5\"\
    \ (a text version of itself), and glues it onto \"result is \"\nIt's all about\
    \ context — once you begin with a string, Java treats subsequent elements as part\
    \ of that string.\n\n</html>"
